A python game modeled after "kings" or "kings cup" I've also heard it called. Meant to bring social gaming into drinking games.

- Never drink alone again!

TODO:

1) set up a menu system to configure the game

2) set up logic for multiple players

3) set up database for cards so there are no repeats
	have option for continuous flow, always random card or 52 cards spread out, or 52 card stacked deck (in order top -> bottom)

4) set up collision detection
	** priority. needs to be done before anything else
